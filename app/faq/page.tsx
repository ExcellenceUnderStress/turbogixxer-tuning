        {
          q: 'How long does a typical dyno session take?',
          a: 'Most dyno tuning sessions take 3-5 hours depending on the complexity of your setup and how well the car is prepared. First-time setups or heavily modified vehicles may require additional time.'
        },
        {
          q: 'How should I prepare my car for tuning?',
          a: 'Ensure your vehicle is in good mechanical condition: check for vacuum leaks, verify all sensors are working, ensure your wideband O2 sensor is calibrated, and make sure you have at least half a tank of quality fuel.'

        },
        {
          q: 'Do I need to purchase tuning software before my appointment?',
          a: 'Yes, you must have your ECU and tuning software/device purchased and installed before your dyno appointment. We can help recommend the right platform for your build.'

      questions: [
        {
          q: 'What do I need for remote tuning?',
          a: 'You\'ll need your ECU with tuning software installed, a reliable wideband O2 sensor, ability to datalog, a safe area to drive and perform pulls, and the ability to email/upload log files.'
        },
        {
          q: 'How long does remote tuning take?',
          a: 'Remote tuning typically takes 1-2 weeks depending on your schedule and ability to complete the required pulls. We\'ll send you a base map to start, then work through multiple revision rounds.'
        },
        {
          q: 'Is remote tuning as good as dyno tuning?',
          a: 'Remote tuning can achieve excellent results when done properly, but dyno tuning allows for more precise optimization. We can typically get you within 5-10% of dyno-tuned power with remote tuning.'

          q: 'Do I get free retunes?',
          a: 'We include 2-4 weeks of revision support (depending on package) after your initial tune for minor adjustments. After this period, or if you make modifications, retuning starts at $200.'
        },
        {
          q: 'What modifications require a retune?',
          a: 'Major modifications like turbo upgrades, injector changes, camshaft swaps, intake manifold changes, or significant boost increases require retuning. Minor changes like exhausts typically don\'t.'

        {
          q: 'Can I watch while you tune my car?',
          a: 'Absolutely! We encourage customers to observe the tuning process. It\'s a great learning experience and helps you understand what we\'re doing with your vehicle.'
